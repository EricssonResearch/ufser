# uFser -- the uFaaS serialization library

This is the MicroFunctions C++ serialization library as a stand-alone project. The code is believed to be excessively documented in the `ufser.h` header file.

To use it, include this project as a submodule, build with `configure` and link your code to the generated *convenience* library (which really just consists of a single object file).
